# NrOS benchmarks

This directory contains the raw data for the NrOS throughput and latency benchmarks. The `verified`
directory contains results for our verified implementation, while `unverified` contains results for
NrOS' default implementation.

NrOS' source code is available at https://github.com/vmware-labs/node-replicated-kernel.

The benchmarks correspond to the ones reported on in the [NrOS paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi21-bhardwaj.pdf) for the 2x14 Skylake system.
